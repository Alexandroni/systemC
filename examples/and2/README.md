This is a simple example using systemc to create an AND2 port. <br/>

Note: The testbench files were modifed from Vivado HLS systemc Examples.<br/>

The following steps should be follow in order to Vivado HLS synthesise.<br/>

1 - Create a folder to contains the AND2 files<br/>

2 - copy all files to it
    -> sources : and2.h, and2.cpp
    -> Testbench: and2_test.cpp
    -> tb_driver.cpp
    -> tb_driver.h
    -> tb_init.cpp
    -> tb_init.h
    -> result.golden.dat
